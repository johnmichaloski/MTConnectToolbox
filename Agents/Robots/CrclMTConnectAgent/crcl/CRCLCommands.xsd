      This ontology models commands written in the canonical robot command
      language (CRCL). CRCL is a low-level messaging language for telling a
      robot what to do. CRCL commands are executed by a low-level device
      controller. The usual source of CRCL commands is a plan/program
      execution system.

      CRCL is intended for use with devices typically described as
      industrial robots and for other positionable automated devices such
      as automated guided vehicles (AGVs). An AGV with a robotic arm
      attached may be regarded as a single robot responding to a single
      stream of CRCL commands or as two robots responding to two separate
      streams of CRCL commands.

      Although CRCL is not a programming language, the commands are in the
      context of a session consisting of getting ready for activity,
      performing activities, and becoming quiescent. CRCL commands may be
      collected in files for testing purposes, but executing such files (by
      giving the commands in the order they occur in the file) should not
      be the normal operating mode of a robot.

      The robot model on which the CRCL commands are based has a controlled
      point and orientation. The speed, and acceleration that are the
      subject of CRCL commands apply to the controlled point. The positions
      (Poses) that are the subject of CRCL commands apply to the controlled
      point and orientation. The coordinate system for Poses in CRCL
      commands is the coordinate system of the workstation in which the
      robot is working.

      For a robot designed to use a single end effector, when the robot has
      an end effector such as a gripper attached, the controlled point is a
      point designated by the robot system designer that is fixed in the
      coordinate system of the end effector. For most purposes, that point
      should be near the place on the end effector where the end effector
      performs its function (between the jaws of a gripper, for example).
      The location of the coordinate system of the end effector with
      respect to the mechanical components of the end effector must be set
      by the robot system designer. CRCL commands are used to specify
      orientation by describing where the Z and X axes of the end effector
      coordinate system should point.

      Also for a robot designed to use a single end effector, when no end
      effector is attached, the controlled point is a point designated by
      the robot system designer that is fixed in the coordinate system of
      the robot component (call it LastLink) to which an end effector may
      be attached. The location of the coordinate system of LastLink with
      respect to the mechanical components of LastLink must be set by the
      robot system designer. CRCL commands may be used to specify
      orientation of LastLink by describing where the Z and X axes of the
      LastLink coordinate system should point.

      Attaching or detaching an end effector changes the controlled point.

      Where command arguments are in terms of units, the units are as set
      by the most recent SetXXXUnits command. If no SetXXXUnits command for
      a given unit type has been executed since the last InitCanonType
      command was executed, the following default units apply:
        length -- meter
        angle  -- radian
        force  -- newton
        torque -- newtonMeter

      For an AGV without an end effector, the controlled point is a point
      designated by the robot system designer that is fixed in the
      coordinate system of the AGV. The location of the coordinate system
      of the AGV with respect to the mechanical components of the AGV must
      be set by the robot system designer. CRCL commands may be used to
      specify orientation of the AGV by describing where the Z and X axes
      of the AGV coordinate system should point.

      If any joint setting or joint status reporting is done, it is assumed
      that the system sending canonical commands and the system executing
      them both know the kinematics of the robot and have the same
      numbering system for the joints, starting with 1. The two systems
      also have the same understanding of where the zero point is and which
      direction is positive for each joint.

      In order that this file may be translatable into OWL, all
      complexTypes in this file include the (optional) Name element,
      inherited from DataThingType. If an instance file has instances of
      complex data without names, it will not be translatable into OWL.

      This file uses the term 'single axis rotation' (and similar terms
      such as 'single axis rotational speed'). When referring to motion
      from one pose to another. It is always possible to find a single axis
      and an amount of rotation around that axis that moves from one
      orientation to another. That rotation is what is meant by 'single
      axis rotation'.

      A few abbreviations are used in names. They are
        Accel = Acceleration
        Trans = Translational
        Rot   = Rotational

          Name (inherited, optional)
          CommandID (inherited)
          ResetAll
          ConfigureJointReport (multiple).

        ConfigureJointReportsType is used to specify how the status of the
        robot joints should be reported. The ConfigureJointReports command
        may be used more than once during a session to change joint status
        reporting.

        If ResetAll is set to true, an instance of
        ConfigureJointReportsType resets the joint reporting of all
        joints, and, in that case, if there is no ConfigureJointReport
        element for a joint in the instance, the status of that joint
        should not be reported. Thus, an instance of
        ConfigureJointReportsType with ResetAll set to true and no
        ConfigureJointReport elements turns off all joint reporting.

        If ResetAll is set to false, status reporting is changed for only
        those joints given in a ConfigureJointReport element. Status
        reporting for other joints remains the same.

        No joint may appear in more than one ConfigureJointReport element.
        Joint numbers in ConfigureJointReport elements must be given in
        increasing order.

        An instance of MoveScrewType has the following elements:
          Name (inherited, optional)
          CommandID (inherited)
          StartPosition (optional)
          AxisPoint (optional)
          AxialDistanceFree (optional)
          AxialDistanceScrew
          Turn.

        This command is designed for attaching screws, nuts, and bolts.
        It might also be used for drilling.

        The command is executed as follows.

        First, if the StartPosition exists, the controlled point and axis
        are moved to the StartPosition along any convenient trajectory.

        Second, if the AxialDistanceFree exists and is not zero, the
        controlled point is moved along the axis by the given
        AxialDistanceFree.

        Third and finally, a screwing motion is made. If there is no
        AxisPoint (or if an AxisPoint is given that is at the controlled
        point), the gripper rotates around its axis through the angle given
        by Turn at a constant rate while simultaneously translating along
        the axis at a constant rate (the currently set speed) through the
        AxialDistanceScrew so that the rotation and translation finish at
        the same time. If there is an AxisPoint and it differs from the
        location of the controlled point, the controlled point
        simultaneously (1) rotates as above, (2) revolves around an axis
        through the AxisPoint parallel to the controlled axis, and (3)
        translates as above. That makes a helical motion of the controlled
        point. The motion along the helix is done at the currently set
        speed.

        A positive value of AxialDistanceFree or AxialDistanceScrew means
        to move away from the end effector. A negative value means to move
        toward the end effector.

        A positive value of Turn means to rotate (and possibly revolve) in
        a counterclockwise sense as viewed from the positive Z axis of the
        gripper (the region extending away from the gripper).

        The robot must reach the EndPosition within the tolerance
        established (1) by the tolerance given for the pose in the
        EndPosition, if there is a tolerance in the EndPosition, or if not
        (2) by the most recently executed instance of
        SetEndPoseToleranceType. The speed and acceleration to use are set
        either in the EndPosition or by previously executed CRCL commands.

        In an instance file, the type of StartPosition may be either
        PoseType or PoseAndSetType, which is derived from PoseType.

        MoveThroughToType is derived from MiddleCommandType. 
        An instance of MoveThroughToType has the following elements:
          Name (inherited, optional)
          CommandID (inherited)
          MoveStraight
          Waypoint (multiple)
          NumPositions.

        Each Waypoint before the last is a Pose that the robot should move
        through. The last Waypoint is the Pose the robot should be in after
        the command is fully executed. NumPositions is the number of
        instances of the Waypoint element. The robot must pass each point
        within the tolerance established (1) by the tolerance given for the
        pose in the Waypoint, if there is a tolerance in the Waypoint, or
        if not (2) by the most recently executed instance of
        SetIntermediatePoseToleranceType (or by SetEndPoseToleranceType for
        the final Waypoint). The speed and acceleration to use are set
        either in the Waypoint or by previously executed CRCL commands.

        If the value of MoveStraight is true, the controlled point must be
        moved in a straight line between Waypoints. If the value of
        MoveStraight is false, the controlled point may be moved along any
        convenient trajectory between Waypoints. In either case, there are
        no restrictions on the values of XAxis and ZAxis between waypoints.

        The type of each Waypoint may be either PoseType or
        PoseAndSetType, which is derived from PoseType.

          Tolerance (optional).

        PoseAndSetType is used for waypoints of move commands. The
        TransSpeed and TransAccel elements are the target translational
        speed and acceleration for the controlled point as it moves to the
        given pose. The RotSpeed and RotAccel elements are the target
        rotational speed and acceleration for the single axis rotation
        required to move from the initial pose to the target pose. The
        Tolerance is the tolerance for the given pose. The TransSpeed,
        TransAccel, RotSpeed, RotAccel, and Tolerance temporarily override
        any set values. The set values apply again once the given pose is
        reached. If the Coordinated element is set to true, translation and
        rotation should finish simultaneously. If Coordinated is false,
        either translation or rotation may finish first.
